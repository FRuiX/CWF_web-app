Code With FGG - Web Application
=========================================

To future FGG hackers.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo to your branch
2. Start to code in your forked branch
3. Create a PR to us after your work is done

_P.S Pseudocode is acceptable._

## What do you have in the repository

- a mock database called "products.json"
- a set of UI mockups

## What shoud you do

You should create a **full stack web application** that should be:

- responsive SPA **without** using any CSS framework (Bootstrap/Semantic UI/Foundation/etc.)
- built with Webpack
- http APIs driven with Node.js

## what are we expecting

- knowledge of Git/Github
- capacity of any web frameworks such as Vue/React/Angular/Express/Hapi/Koa...
- resonable structure and readable/testable code (including unit tests if possible)
- a good README to tell us how to contribute/deploy the app
- plain and simple commit messages
- sense of UI/UX
- finish in 2-3 hours
- etc.

**Anyway, if you would, we love to see a prettier, more ergonomically designed App instead of reproducing the mockups. So just take your time and do the best. 加油 :)**
